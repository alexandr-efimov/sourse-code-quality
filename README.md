Clean Code related tasks for skills improvements. Tasks were divided into groups:
- basic
- advanced


# Basic 
Tasks are to refactor everything you think looks strange/unclear/has code smells, according to main clean code 
principles. During refactoring take attention to: 
- naming
- functions
- comments
- formatting
- classes and objects 

Recommended refactoring time - up to 4h

# Advanced
Simple project with code smells and bad practices usage to be refactored. Taken as assumption that during refactoring 
you will go according
clean code related principles, practices and refactoring techniques. Anti patterns used in 
project should be avoided and replaced best practices. For more details check readme under appropriate module please.

Recommended refactoring time - up to 4h


# DOD
Definition of done (DOD) for each task described separately, in each sub module(basic/advanced), but overall common 
rules are next
 - Code inspection results (default Intellij Idea inspection profile). Zero or close to it warnings amount. The 
 less  warnings - the better(Java Doc related warnings can be omitted and not taken into account, you can disable it)
 - Sonar Lint inspection. Same rules -zero or near to it issues amount is best.
 - Unit tests. All existing tests should be with positive results. Adding new tests - additional plus.
